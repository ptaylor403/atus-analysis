### What the code should do
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes yearly data about Americans' use of their time.
Using this information for 2014:
- Compare different populations (people with children and people without, people of differing age groups, men and women, or other groupings)
- Answer macro-level questions and micro-level questions (for example, the amount of leisure for the macro-level, the types of things people do for leisure for the micro-level)
